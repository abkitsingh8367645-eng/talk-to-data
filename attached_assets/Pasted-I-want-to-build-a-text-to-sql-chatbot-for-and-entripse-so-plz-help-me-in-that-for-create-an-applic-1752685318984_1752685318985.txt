i wantrr reespone in stre,ing form
ia lso want chart in response.
i also want to see the agent name ans its thinbkign while genartet the answer.
user can also option to got for begin new chat



Show me production trends for last 6 months , this question should appear on text box when user enter it the we can see the thinking box / containet should appear and all the processing and thinking steps happens their. 

first it will go to the Orchestrator Agent, it will classify it as Descriptive Analytics ans route it to Descriptive agent, now the Descriptive agent will start ansysisi th e query and start creating the sql query and after tha it will sue the sql-query execution tool and whne its run successful ,m it will pass the respone to Response Generation agent , the resposn genarteion will give the respons ein streming mnnner and create chart for it.


the final respon ssholuld be in stremming mannser and aftr thwe can see tah chat box.

now create this app, so thing what we can add ,
